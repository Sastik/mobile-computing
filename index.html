            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Roaming:</b> The ability for a cellular customer to
              automatically make and receive voice calls, send and receive data,
              or access other services when travelling outside the geographical
              coverage area of the home network.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Handover Management:</b> The process of transferring an ongoing
              call or data session from one cell to another as a mobile device
              moves between cells.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>GSM networks use various handover techniques, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Intra-cell handover</li>

            4. What is Hand-off? Differentiate between Soft Hand-off and Hard
            Hand-off
          </h2>
          <p>
            Hand-off (or Handover) is a process in mobile communication systems
            where an ongoing call or data session is transferred from one cell
            to another without disconnecting the session.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This ensures seamless communication as a mobile user moves through
              different coverage areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The primary goal of a hand-off is to maintain uninterrupted
              service.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Types of Handoffs:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Hard Handoff:</b> In this strategy, the connection to the
              current cell is broken before a new connection is established with
              the target cell.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Soft Handoff:</b> Soft Handoff is a mechanism in which the
              device gets connected with two or more base stations at the same
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Delayed Handoff:</b> Delayed handoff occurs when no base
              station is available for accepting the transfer. The call
              continues until the signal strength reaches a threshold, and after
              that, the call is dropped.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mobile-Assisted Handoff:</b> Mobile-Assisted handoff is
              generally used when a mobile phone helps a base station to
              transfer the call to another base station with better-improvised
              connectivity and more signal strength.

            6. What is Multiple Access Technique? Do a Comparative Study among
            FDMA, TDMA & CDMA?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Multiple Access Technique refers to a method that allows multiple
            users to share the same frequency communication channel effectively
            without interference.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The multiplexing is provided in the physical layer, and the shared
              communication medium can be wired cables or wireless spectrum.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Types of Multiple Access Techniques:</h3>
          <h4>1. Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA):</h4>
          <p>
            The available frequency band is divided into multiple frequency
            channels, each assigned to a different user or communication link.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Usage:</b> Commonly used in analog systems and early cellular
              networks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Advantages:</b> Simple implementation, minimal timing
              requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Disadvantages:</b> Inefficient use of bandwidth, fixed
              allocation of frequencies can lead to underutilization.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>2. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA):</h4>
          <p>
            The available frequency is divided into time slots, and each user is
            assigned a specific time slot during which they can transmit or
            receive data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Usage:</b> Used in digital systems such as GSM.</li>
            <li><b>Advantages:</b> Dynamic allocation of time slots.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Disadvantages:</b> Requires potential delay due to time slot
              allocation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>3. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA):</h4>
          <p>
            Each user is assigned a unique code, and all users can transmit
            simultaneously over the same frequency band.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Usage:</b> Used in 3G networks and technologies.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Advantages:</b> High capacity, better resistance to
              interference.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Disadvantages:</b> Complex implementation, requires
              sophisticated signal processing.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>8. Define Packet Switching and Circuit Switching</h2>
          <h3>Packet Switching:</h3>
          <p>
            Packet switching is a communication method where data is divided
            into smaller units called packets and transmitted over the network.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each packet contains the source and destination addresses, as well
              as other information needed for routing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Advantages of Packet Switching:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Efficient use of bandwidth:</b> Packet switching is efficient
              because bandwidth is shared among multiple users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Flexible:</b> Packet switching is flexible and can handle a
              wide range of data rates and packet sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Scalable:</b> Packet switching is highly scalable and can
              handle large amounts of traffic on a network.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Lower cost:</b> Packet switching is less expensive than circuit
              switching.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Disadvantages of Packet Switching:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Higher latency:</b> Packet switching has higher latency.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Costs:</b> Installation costs of packet switching are
              expensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Packet loss:</b> Packet switching can result in packet loss due
              to congestion on the network.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Examples:</h4>
          <p>
            The Internet, where data such as emails, web pages, and files are
            transmitted using protocols like TCP/IP.
          </p>

          <h3>Circuit Switching:</h3>
          <p>
            Circuit switching is defined as the method of switching which is
            used for establishing a dedicated communication path between the
            sender and the receiver. The link which is established between the
            sender and the receiver is in the physical form.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This path remains reserved exclusively for the session until it is
              terminated.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Advantages of Circuit Switching:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Fixed Bandwidth:</b> The bandwidth used is fixed.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Fixed Data Transmission Rate:</b> The rate at which the data is
              transmitted is fixed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>No Waiting Time During Switching:</b> While switching, no time
              is wasted in waiting.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Disadvantages of Circuit Switching:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>High Bandwidth Requirement:</b> Since dedicated channels are
              used, the bandwidth required is more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Inefficient Resource Utilization:</b> The utilization of
              resources is not full.
            </li>
            <li><b>High Cost:</b> Circuit switching is expensive.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Examples:</h4>
          <p>
            Traditional telephone networks and ISDN where a continuous,
            dedicated connection is required.

          </ul>
          <h3>GPRS Network Architecture:</h3>
          <p>
            GPRS tries to make maximum use of the existing physical structure of
            GSM. It has introduced a new entity named GPRS support nodes (GSN)
            whose responsibility is to route and deliver a data packet.
          </p>
          <ul>

              <b>Mobile Station (MS):</b> Requires enhanced mobile stations to
              support high-speed data packets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Base Station Controller (BSC):</b> In GSM architecture there is
              one component called BSC. But in GPRS there is one component is
              added to BSC called PCU. PCU stands for Packet Control Unit. If
              the signal comes to BSC and that signal contains data, then PCU
              routes to the SGSN.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>GPRS Support Nodes:</b> GPRS support nodes are of two types:

          <h3>a) Mobile IP</h3>
          <p>
            Mobile IP is a communication protocol that allows the users to move
            from one network to another with the same IP address. It ensures
            that the communication will continue without the userâ€™s sessions or
            connections being dropped.

            <li>
              <b>Mobile Node (MN):</b> The hand-held communication device that
              the user carries, e.g., Cell phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Home Agent (HA):</b> A router in the home network to which the
              mobile node was originally connected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Home Address:</b> The permanent IP address assigned to the
              mobile node (within its home network).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Foreign Agent (FA):</b> A router in a foreign network to which
              the mobile node is currently connected.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Advantages of Mobile IP:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Seamless Connectivity:</b> Allows mobile devices to maintain
              ongoing sessions while moving across different networks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Transparency:</b> The communication with the correspondent node

            of Mobile IP?
          </h2>
          <h3>Tunnelling:</h3>
          <p>
            Tunneling establishes a virtual path (tunnel) for data packets
            between two points (entry and endpoint).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Process:</b> Packets enter the tunnel at the entry point,
              travel through it, and exit unchanged at the endpoint.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Purpose:</b> Ensures seamless delivery of packets to the mobile
              node (MN) as it moves across networks.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Encapsulation:</h3>
          <p>The process of wrapping an original packet within a new packet.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Mechanism:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The home agent (HA) takes the original packet, inserts it into
                  the data part of a new packet, and adds a new IP header (outer
                  header).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The outer header routes the packet to the mobile node's
                  care-of address (CoA).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
